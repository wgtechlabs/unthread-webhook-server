A **production-ready Node.js webhook server** specifically engineered for Unthread.io integration - built with TypeScript, Express.js, and Redis for reliable webhook event processing. This server implements proper HMAC-SHA256 signature verification, handles URL verification, and queues events for asynchronous processing with enterprise-grade security and error handling.

**Perfect for Discord bots, Telegram bots, web applications, and any service that needs to process Unthread.io webhook events reliably.** Whether you're building customer support automation, community management tools, or advanced ticketing systems, this webhook server provides the robust foundation you need.

## ‚ù£Ô∏è Motivation

Picture this: You're building an amazing Discord bot or customer support system that integrates with Unthread.io, but you're spending more time wrestling with webhook verification, event processing, and Redis queue management than actually building features. Sound familiar? I've been there too.

I created Unthread Webhook Server because every developer deserves a **reliable, secure, and battle-tested foundation** for processing Unthread.io webhooks. No more manual HMAC verification, no more fragile event handling, no more reinventing the wheel. Just clean, TypeScript-powered webhook processing that scales with your application and keeps your users happy.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Unthread.io Compliant**: Full HMAC-SHA256 signature verification and URL verification support - meets all Unthread security requirements out of the box.
- **TypeScript First**: 100% TypeScript codebase with strict type checking, comprehensive type definitions, and excellent IntelliSense support for confident development.
- **Redis Queue Integration**: Automatic event queuing to Redis with configurable queue names based on your target platform - perfect for microservices architecture.
- **Enterprise Security**: Robust signature verification, request validation, environment variable enforcement, and comprehensive error handling.
- **Zero Configuration**: Intelligent auto-configuration with sensible defaults - just set your environment variables and start processing webhooks.
- **Production Ready**: Battle-tested error handling, logging with [@wgtechlabs/log-engine](https://github.com/wgtechlabs/log-engine), and designed for high-throughput production environments.
- **Developer Experience**: Beautiful colored logs, comprehensive documentation, and simple API that you can master in minutes.
- **Yarn Enforced**: Consistent dependency management with automatic npm blocking - ensures reliable builds across all environments.

## ü§î How It Works

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD051 -->

1. **Webhook Reception**: The server receives POST requests from Unthread.io at the `/unthread-webhook` endpoint with proper CORS and security headers
2. **Signature Verification**: Each incoming request is validated using HMAC-SHA256 signature verification against your Unthread webhook secret
3. **Event Processing**: Valid webhook events are parsed, validated, and processed according to Unthread's event structure requirements
4. **Redis Queuing**: Events are automatically published to a Redis queue (`${TARGET_PLATFORM}-webhook-queue`) for asynchronous processing by your application
5. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling ensures failed requests are logged and properly responded to, maintaining webhook reliability

## üì¶ Installation

### Prerequisites

This project uses [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) as the package manager. Please ensure you have Yarn installed:

```bash
# Install Yarn globally if you haven't already
npm install -g yarn

# Verify installation
yarn --version
```

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
yarn install
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: This project enforces the use of Yarn. If you try to use `npm install`, it will be blocked automatically.

### 2. Environment Setup

Copy the example environment file and configure it:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` with your configuration:

```env
PORT=3000
UNTHREAD_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_actual_signing_secret_here
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379
TARGET_PLATFORM=discord
```

> **Note**: The Redis queue name is automatically generated as `${TARGET_PLATFORM}-webhook-queue` for consistency.

### 3. Start Redis

Make sure Redis is running on your system:

```bash
# On Ubuntu/Debian
sudo systemctl start redis-server

# On macOS with Homebrew
brew services start redis

# Using Docker
docker run -d -p 6379:6379 redis:alpine
```

### 4. Run the Server

```bash
# Development mode with auto-reload
yarn dev

# Production mode
yarn start
```

The server will start on `http://localhost:3000` with the following endpoints:

- `GET /health` - Health check endpoint
- `POST /unthread-webhook` - Main webhook endpoint for Unthread

## üïπÔ∏è Usage

### Quick Start

Your Unthread webhook server is ready to receive events! Just configure your webhook URL in your Unthread dashboard:

```text
https://your-domain.com/unthread-webhook
```

The server automatically handles:

- **HMAC-SHA256 signature verification** - Ensures webhook authenticity
- **URL verification events** - Responds to Unthread's verification challenges
- **Event queuing to Redis** - Queues events for asynchronous processing
- **Error handling and logging** - Comprehensive error tracking and logging

### Unthread Configuration

#### 1. Get Your Signing Secret

1. Go to your [Unthread Dashboard](https://dashboard.unthread.io)
2. Navigate to Webhooks settings
3. Copy your signing secret and add it to your `.env` file

#### 2. Configure Webhook URL

In your Unthread dashboard, set your webhook URL to:

```text
https://your-domain.com/unthread-webhook
```

For local testing, you can use tools like [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/):

```bash
# Install ngrok and expose your local server
ngrok http 3000
```
