A reliable, production-ready Node.js server for processing Unthread.io webhooks with signature verification and smart platform handling. Built with TypeScript, Express.js, and Redis, this webhook server provides secure HMAC-SHA256 signature validation, intelligent event deduplication, seamless integration with multiple platforms including Discord and Telegram, and **advanced file attachment correlation** that accurately detects source platforms for file uploads. The server automatically detects event sources, processes various webhook events (conversations, messages, status updates), correlates file attachments with their originating platforms, and efficiently queues them through Redis for downstream consumption by your bot applications, ensuring reliable and scalable webhook processing for your Unthread.io integrations.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file from the example:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Required variables:

| Variable | Description | Default | Required |
|----------|-------------|---------|----------|
| `UNTHREAD_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | Your Unthread.io signing secret | - | ‚úÖ |
| `NODE_ENV` | Environment mode | `development` | ‚ùå |
| `PORT` | Server port | `3000` | ‚ùå |
| `TARGET_PLATFORM` | Platform identifier (e.g., telegram, discord) | - | ‚úÖ |
| `REDIS_URL` | Redis connection URL | `redis://localhost:6379` | ‚ùå |

### Getting Your Unthread Signing Secret

1. Go to [Unthread Dashboard](https://dashboard.unthread.io)
2. Navigate to **Webhooks** settings
3. Copy your signing secret to `UNTHREAD_WEBHOOK_SECRET` in `.env`
4. Set your webhook URL to: `https://your-domain.com/unthread-webhook`

For local testing, use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/): `ngrok http 3000`

## üîß How It Works

1. **Webhook Reception**: Receives POST requests from Unthread.io at `/unthread-webhook`
2. **Security**: Validates HMAC-SHA256 signatures using your webhook secret
3. **Deduplication**: Prevents duplicate event processing with Redis TTL cache
4. **Platform Detection**: Identifies if events come from dashboard or target platform
5. **File Attachment Correlation**: Smart correlation system that links file attachments with their source platforms instead of marking them as "unknown"
6. **Queue Publishing**: Sends processed events to Redis `unthread-events` queue with enhanced attachment metadata

### üéØ File Attachment Intelligence

This server features advanced file attachment correlation that:

- **Eliminates "Unknown" Sources**: Automatically correlates file upload events with their originating platform (Dashboard, Telegram, Discord, etc.)
- **Memory-Based Correlation**: Uses intelligent caching to match message events with subsequent file upload events
- **Rich Metadata Generation**: Provides comprehensive attachment summaries including file count, total size, MIME types, and file names
- **Multi-Event Buffering**: Handles multiple file attachments in a single conversation with timeout-based processing
- **Backwards Compatibility**: Existing integrations continue to work without modification

## üìä Event Processing

### Supported Events
- `url_verification` - Automatic URL verification
- `conversation_created` - New conversations
- `conversation_updated` - Status changes  
- `conversation_deleted` - Conversation removal
- `message_created` - New messages

### Redis Queue Format

Events are queued with this enhanced structure:

```json
{
  "platform": "unthread",
  "targetPlatform": "telegram",
  "type": "message_created", 
  "sourcePlatform": "dashboard",
  "data": {
    "eventId": "evt_123456789",
    "conversationId": "conv_abc123",
    "content": "Hello from support!",
    "eventTimestamp": 1733097600000,
    "files": [
      {
        "id": "F123ABC456",
        "name": "document.pdf",
        "size": 524288,
        "mimetype": "application/pdf"
      }
    ]
  },
  "attachments": {
    "hasFiles": true,
    "fileCount": 1,
    "totalSize": 524288,
    "types": ["application/pdf"],
    "names": ["document.pdf"]
  },
  "timestamp": 1733097600000
}
```

**New Enhancement**: Events with file attachments now include an `attachments` metadata object providing:
- `hasFiles`: Boolean indicating presence of files
- `fileCount`: Total number of attached files  
- `totalSize`: Combined size of all files in bytes
- `types`: Array of unique MIME types (deduplicated)
- `names`: Array of all file names (maintains order)

## üîç Monitoring

### Health Check

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/health
```

**Healthy Response:**
```json
{
  "status": "OK",
  "redis": "connected",
  "timestamp": "2025-06-21T12:00:00.000Z"
}
```

**Error Response:**
```json
{
  "status": "ERROR", 
  "redis": "disconnected",
  "timestamp": "2025-06-21T12:00:00.000Z"
}
```

### Troubleshooting

**Redis Connection Issues:**

- Verify Redis is running: `redis-cli ping`
- Check `REDIS_URL` in your `.env` file
- Review server logs for connection errors

**Platform Detection Issues:**

- Check logs for detection summary details
- Verify event structure matches Unthread format
- Events may be classified as "unknown" for edge cases

**File Attachment Correlation Issues:**

- Verify `TARGET_PLATFORM` is set correctly in your `.env` file
- Check correlation logs for timing and buffering details
- File events without correlation data will fall back to "unknown" source
- Correlation window is 15 seconds - events outside this window may not correlate

**Common Solutions:**

- Restart the server if platform detection seems inconsistent
- Clear Redis cache if experiencing correlation issues: `redis-cli FLUSHDB`
- Enable debug logging by setting `NODE_ENV=development` for detailed correlation logs

## üöÄ Integration Benefits

### For Bot Developers

- **Accurate Source Detection**: No more "unknown" file attachment sources - get precise platform identification
- **Rich File Metadata**: Access file counts, sizes, types, and names without parsing complex file arrays
- **Simplified Integration**: Use the `attachments` metadata for quick file handling logic
- **Backwards Compatibility**: Existing code continues to work unchanged

### For Production Systems

- **Reliable Correlation**: Memory-based correlation system with 15-second timing windows and automatic fallbacks
- **Robust Error Handling**: Comprehensive timeout management and duplicate prevention
- **Scalable Architecture**: Efficient Redis-based queuing with TTL cleanup and deduplication
- **Production-Ready**: Extensive logging, monitoring, and error recovery mechanisms
