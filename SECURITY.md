## 🚨 Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

We take security seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly: 

### Private Vulnerability Reporting (Recommended)

This repository has **private vulnerability reporting** enabled.  You can securely report vulnerabilities directly through GitHub: 

1. Navigate to the [**Security**](../../security) tab
2. Click [**Advisories**](../../security/advisories)
3. Click **"Report a vulnerability"** button
4. Fill out the vulnerability details

This allows us to discuss and fix the issue privately before any public disclosure.

**Please do NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**
