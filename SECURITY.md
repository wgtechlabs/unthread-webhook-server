## üîê Security Considerations

This webhook server handles sensitive operations and external requests. Key security areas include:

### HMAC Signature Verification
- All webhook requests must include valid HMAC-SHA256 signatures
- Signatures are verified against your Unthread webhook secret
- Invalid signatures are rejected immediately

### Environment Security
- Store your `UNTHREAD_WEBHOOK_SECRET` securely
- Use environment variables, never hardcode secrets
- Regularly rotate your webhook secrets

### Redis Security
- Secure your Redis instance with authentication
- Use TLS encryption for Redis connections in production
- Limit Redis access to authorized applications only

### Network Security
- Deploy behind a reverse proxy or load balancer
- Use HTTPS/TLS for all webhook endpoints
- Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse

### Input Validation
- All webhook payloads are validated before processing
- Malformed requests are rejected with appropriate error responses
- Event deduplication prevents replay attacks

## üè≠ Production Security Checklist

Before deploying to production:

- [ ] Use HTTPS/TLS for all endpoints
- [ ] Secure Redis with authentication and encryption
- [ ] Set strong, unique webhook secrets
- [ ] Implement proper logging and monitoring
- [ ] Use environment variables for all secrets
- [ ] Deploy behind a reverse proxy
- [ ] Enable rate limiting
- [ ] Regular security updates for dependencies
